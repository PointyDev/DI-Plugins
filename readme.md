# Plugins

This is a collection of plugins for the [DiscordInjections](https://github.com/DiscordInjections/DiscordInjections) project.

## Contribution

To contribute a plugin, please make a PR. Your plugin should follow the following structure:

```
Folder - PluginName
  |
  |-- css (optional)
  | |-- css files (optional)
  |-- index.js (or as specified in package.json)
  |-- readme.md
  |-- package.json
  |-- config.json (is generated, see below)
  |-- license.md (optional)
```

You may have as many CSS files in the `css` folder as you desire. They will, however, all be combined into a single style element before being injected.

The `index.js` file name can be configured with the `main` property in the `package.json` file. The `package.json` file is **required**, and can be generated by doing `npm init` inside your plugin directory. All module dependencies for your plugin should also be in this file.

The `config.json` file is automatically generated based on the `configTemplate` property in your `index.js` file. **Please do not commit this file.**

You may also use JS files for `package.json` and `config.json`.

Please refer to `SamplePlugin/SamplePlugin.js` for a plugin template.
